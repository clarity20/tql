Note 1: The plan is to create a long series of open issues in keeping with
common open-source practice. For now, this flat ASCII list of (the most
significant) TODO items will suffice.

Note 2: TQL is ambitious enough that a full TODO list would be endless. First
of all, there are countless ways to improve upon command-line SQL for more
terseness and general ease-of-use for the power user. Second of all, the top
priority for this project has always been to build out the feature set to make
the project as useful (and interesting) as possible. Engineering concerns are
secondary. The code is good but, as with any project, the code can be improved
in various ways. This alone gives rise to a fairly extensive TODO list. See
"Style TODO" for a start.

Features TODO
    Expression Master: A large architectural change having three major parts.
        The TODOs in this section are grouped according to the part that they
        apply to. The overarching project will expand the universe of
        acceptable input expressions so that many more kinds of queries can be
        realized through the TQL engine.

        (1) lexer/parser: Implementation nearly done.
            Refactor the NCV-finding logic into a preprocessing step
            Some edge cases are implemented but not tested
            Main function body is too long
            Keep or ditch the space tokens? and superfluous parentheses around NCVs?
                Add options, --clean/--preserve, with the former the default

        (2) smart expander: In progress.
            Construct a simplified, high-level expander and query assembler for
                WHEREs similar to the one used for SELECTs
            Add the literal string to the candidate match lists in the case of
                simple right-hand-side expansions
            Design an expander/assembler for UPDATEs to resemble WHEREs & SELECTs
            Add function-name expansion capability
            Add word-sequence expansion capability
            Identify depth of subexpressions from parens and order-of-operations
            Define legal combinations of data types and the types that the
                combinations resolve to
            Resolve the data types of expressions based on their subtrees

        (3) query builder: Not yet started.
            Preliminary design work for transformations / "operator overloading"
            Handle the COUNT(*) function

    Finish the automatic sorting of output lines
    Finish the "++" prefix operator for SELECT-type arguments
    Implement -ob,-gb,-go flags for ORDER BY and GROUP BY (-o is already taken)
    Automatically build a HAVING clause when WHERE is not correct
    Perfect the candidate list generation (aka "expand()") by using prioritized
        lists encompassing all matching algorithms 
    Preliminary design work for UNION queries
    Preliminary design work for automatic table joining

        <and scores more...>

Style TODO
    Clean up long lines that wrap
    Recheck comments for accuracy, needfulness, and comprehensibility
    Reorganize code into smaller files, focusing on db_functions
    Consider a case convention for variable and function names
    Consider when & how to indicate variable scope in the name
    Clean up the function foldResultSet()
    Rename the source file db_functions
    Clean up the God-function parseCompletely()
    Rewrite in a language that supports object orientation, sophisticated data
        structures, richer variable scoping, better function call & return
        protocol, etc. A large undertaking and a nice-to-have; the above items
        are more important.

Documentation and Presentation TODO
    Transform this TODO file into a (long?) series of open issues
    Reorganize and rename project files to comply with open-source conventions
    The README should be mostly a detailed usage document
    Revisit the comments for accuracy and clarity, especially function headers
    Compose more material for the project blog

Testing TODO
    Work toward activating and running all parser test cases at once
    Parser tests: update for the new token-counting feature
    Use new features as a springboard to flesh out main-module tests
    Integrate with an existing testing framework such as awesome-shell's "bats"
